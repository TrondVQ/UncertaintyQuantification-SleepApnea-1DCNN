# UncertaintyQuantification-SleepApnea-1DCNN
Code for the Master's Thesis: 'Uncertainty Quantification for Deep Learning in Sleep Apnea Detection.' This repository contains Python scripts for replicating a 1D-CNN model for sleep apnea event classification using the SHHS2 dataset, and for applying and evaluating Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles for uncertainty quantification.
